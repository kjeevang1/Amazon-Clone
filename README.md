# Amazon-Clone
This GitHub repository contains the front-end code for an Amazon clone. It has a navigation bar, a hero section, and product displays, just like Amazon's website. The design is clean, using custom CSS, and has icons from Font Awesome. The project uses HTML for the page structure and CSS for how it looks.
